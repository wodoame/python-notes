In Python, `super()` is a built-in function that is often used in the context of object-oriented programming (OOP) to refer to the parent or superclass. It is typically used in the `__init__` method of a subclass to call the constructor of the parent class. This allows you to initialize the attributes of the subclass while still benefiting from the initialization of the attributes in the parent class.

Here's an example to illustrate the use of `super()`:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)  # Call the constructor of the parent class
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        super().speak()  # Call the speak method of the parent class
        print(f"{self.name} barks")

# Creating an instance of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")

# Calling the speak method of the Dog class
my_dog.speak()
```

In this example, the `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class. The `Dog` class has its own constructor (`__init__`) that initializes the `breed` attribute, but it also wants to make use of the initialization in the `Animal` class. `super().__init__(name)` calls the constructor of the parent class (`Animal`), ensuring that the `name` attribute is initialized.

Similarly, `super().speak()` is used to call the `speak` method of the parent class, allowing the `Dog` class to extend the behavior of the `Animal` class.

Using `super()` helps maintain a clean and cooperative relationship between the base and derived classes, making it easier to manage and understand the code in an inheritance hierarchy.
