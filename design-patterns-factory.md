The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when the exact type of object to be created isn't known until runtime.

### Example in Python

Let's create a simple example to illustrate the Factory Pattern. We'll design a system for creating different types of vehicles.

#### Step 1: Define the Product Interface

First, we'll define an interface for the products that the factory will create.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 2: Implement Concrete Products

Next, we'll implement concrete classes for different types of vehicles.

```python
class Car(Vehicle):
    def create(self):
        return "Car created"

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    def create(self):
        return "Motorcycle created"
```

#### Step 3: Define the Factory Interface

We'll define an interface for the factory that will create the vehicles.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class VehicleFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_vehicle(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 4: Implement Concrete Factories

Now, we'll implement concrete factories for each type of vehicle.

```python
class CarFactory(VehicleFactory):
    def create_vehicle(self):
        return Car()

class MotorcycleFactory(VehicleFactory):
    def create_vehicle(self):
        return Motorcycle()
```

#### Step 5: Use the Factory

Finally, we'll use the factory to create vehicles.

```python
def main():
    car_factory = CarFactory()
    motorcycle_factory = MotorcycleFactory()

    car = car_factory.create_vehicle()
    motorcycle = motorcycle_factory.create_vehicle()

    print(car.create())  # Output: Car created
    print(motorcycle.create())  # Output: Motorcycle created

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Vehicle Interface**: Defines the interface for the products.
2. **Concrete Products**: `Car` and `Motorcycle` implement the `Vehicle` interface.
3. **VehicleFactory Interface**: Defines the interface for the factory.
4. **Concrete Factories**: `CarFactory` and `MotorcycleFactory` implement the `VehicleFactory` interface.
5. **Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use the factories to create different types of vehicles.

This pattern helps in decoupling the client code from the concrete classes, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain¹²³.
