The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a flexible solution to constructing complex objects. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations¹².

### Example in Python

Let's create an example to illustrate the Builder Pattern. We'll design a system for building custom computers.

#### Step 1: Define the Product

First, we'll define the product that the builder will construct.

```python
class Computer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cpu = None
        self.ram = None
        self.storage = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f'CPU: {self.cpu}, RAM: {self.ram}, Storage: {self.storage}'
```

#### Step 2: Define the Builder Interface

Next, we'll define an interface for the builder.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class ComputerBuilder(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def set_cpu(self, cpu):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def set_ram(self, ram):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def set_storage(self, storage):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_computer(self):
        pass
```

#### Step 3: Implement Concrete Builders

Now, we'll implement concrete builders for different types of computers.

```python
class GamingComputerBuilder(ComputerBuilder):
    def __init__(self):
        self.computer = Computer()

    def set_cpu(self, cpu):
        self.computer.cpu = cpu

    def set_ram(self, ram):
        self.computer.ram = ram

    def set_storage(self, storage):
        self.computer.storage = storage

    def get_computer(self):
        return self.computer

class OfficeComputerBuilder(ComputerBuilder):
    def __init__(self):
        self.computer = Computer()

    def set_cpu(self, cpu):
        self.computer.cpu = cpu

    def set_ram(self, ram):
        self.computer.ram = ram

    def set_storage(self, storage):
        self.computer.storage = storage

    def get_computer(self):
        return self.computer
```

#### Step 4: Define the Director

The Director class will manage the construction process.

```python
class Director:
    def __init__(self, builder):
        self.builder = builder

    def construct_computer(self, cpu, ram, storage):
        self.builder.set_cpu(cpu)
        self.builder.set_ram(ram)
        self.builder.set_storage(storage)
        return self.builder.get_computer()
```

#### Step 5: Use the Builder

Finally, we'll use the builder to create different types of computers.

```python
def main():
    gaming_builder = GamingComputerBuilder()
    office_builder = OfficeComputerBuilder()

    director = Director(gaming_builder)
    gaming_computer = director.construct_computer('Intel i9', '32GB', '1TB SSD')
    print(gaming_computer)  # Output: CPU: Intel i9, RAM: 32GB, Storage: 1TB SSD

    director = Director(office_builder)
    office_computer = director.construct_computer('Intel i5', '16GB', '512GB SSD')
    print(office_computer)  # Output: CPU: Intel i5, RAM: 16GB, Storage: 512GB SSD

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Product**: `Computer` is the complex object that the builder constructs.
2. **Builder Interface**: `ComputerBuilder` defines the steps to build a computer.
3. **Concrete Builders**: `GamingComputerBuilder` and `OfficeComputerBuilder` implement the `ComputerBuilder` interface to create specific types of computers.
4. **Director**: Manages the construction process using a builder.
5. **Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use the builder to create different types of computers.

This pattern is particularly useful when you need to construct complex objects step by step and want to ensure that the construction process is flexible and can produce different representations of the object¹²³.
