In Python, the `abc` module provides the infrastructure for defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs). This module is useful for creating abstract classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated directly and are meant to be subclassed.

### Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)

An Abstract Base Class is a class that serves as a blueprint for other classes. It can define methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. Python uses the `abc` module to implement this functionality.

### Key Components

1. **ABC**: This is a helper class that has `ABCMeta` as its metaclass. By inheriting from `ABC`, you can create an abstract base class without directly dealing with metaclasses.
2. **abstractmethod**: This decorator is used to declare methods as abstract. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. Subclasses are required to implement these methods.

### Example

Here's a simple example to illustrate how to use `ABC` and `abstractmethod`:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow"

# Usage
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Bark
print(cat.make_sound())  # Output: Meow
```

In this example:

- **Animal**: This is an abstract base class with an abstract method `make_sound`.
- **Dog** and **Cat**: These are concrete subclasses that implement the `make_sound` method.

### Why Use ABCs?

ABCs are useful for:

- **Enforcing Method Implementation**: Ensuring that certain methods are implemented in subclasses.
- **Providing a Common Interface**: Defining a common interface for a group of related classes.
- **Preventing Instantiation**: Preventing the instantiation of base classes that are meant to be subclassed.

Using ABCs can help you design more robust and maintainable code by clearly defining the expected behavior of subclasses.
