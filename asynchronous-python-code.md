Asynchronous programming in Python allows you to write concurrent code that runs asynchronously, meaning it doesn't happen in real-time. Here are the essentials:

1. **What Is Asynchronous Programming?**
   - Asynchronous programming lets you execute multiple tasks simultaneously or in parallel.
   - Unlike synchronous programs that execute one step at a time, asynchronous programs don't block the entire program when a task is waiting or has completed its work.

2. **Using `async` and `await` in Python:**
   - The `async` and `await` keywords are essential for writing asynchronous programs.
   - Example:
     ```python
     async def get_stuff_async() -> Dict:
         results = await some_long_operation()
         return results["key"]
     ```
     In this example, `get_stuff_async` is an asynchronous function that awaits the completion of `some_long_operation()` before proceeding.

3. **Benefits of Asynchronous Programming:**
   - Speeds up processing time by allowing tasks to run concurrently.
   - Useful for IO-bound operations (e.g., network requests, file I/O) where waiting time can be better utilized for other tasks.

# Some example code I wrote

```python
 import asyncio  

# awaitables (expressions that can be used with await syntaxx) are: coroutines, tasks, futures

async def say_after(seconds, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(seconds)
    print(what)

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(say_after(1, 'hello')) 
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(say_after(2, 'world')) 
    return await asyncio.gather(task1, task2) # a list of all return values from awaitables will be returned
    
    # or
    # await task1 
    # await task2

# using asyncio.TaskGroup to create tasks
async def main1():
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg: 
        task1 = tg.create_task(say_after(1, 'hello'))
        task2 = tg.create_task(say_after(2, 'world')) 
        # awaiting is implicit after the context manager exits
    
print(asyncio.run(main()))
```
