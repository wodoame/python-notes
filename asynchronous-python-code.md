Asynchronous programming in Python allows you to write concurrent code that runs asynchronously, meaning it doesn't happen in real-time. Here are the essentials:

1. **What Is Asynchronous Programming?**
   - Asynchronous programming lets you execute multiple tasks simultaneously or in parallel.
   - Unlike synchronous programs that execute one step at a time, asynchronous programs don't block the entire program when a task is waiting or has completed its work.

2. **Using `async` and `await` in Python:**
   - The `async` and `await` keywords are essential for writing asynchronous programs.
   - Example:
     ```python
     async def get_stuff_async() -> Dict:
         results = await some_long_operation()
         return results["key"]
     ```
     In this example, `get_stuff_async` is an asynchronous function that awaits the completion of `some_long_operation()` before proceeding‚Å¥.

3. **Benefits of Asynchronous Programming:**
   - Speeds up processing time by allowing tasks to run concurrently.
   - Useful for IO-bound operations (e.g., network requests, file I/O) where waiting time can be better utilized for other tasks.
